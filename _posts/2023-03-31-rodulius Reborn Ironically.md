fuck you; and your societal laws.  
narrow your walls, feel the sunlight shrink.  
heaven weeps to see such vile treatment of her gift;  
with a world so fruitful, why do you chase the one of poison?  
Dionysus and his Baccahe have driven the world to madness for throwing such pitiless wishes into her well.  
feel the torment, expect divine repercussions;  
since the Bronze age, man has dwindled; heroes grow thin.  
gazing up, Uranus stays afar; ashamed of what has become of his mother.  
fuck you; and your societal laws.
