care not what the outside feels when they peer in;  for what business is it of theirs to make such judgements?  worldy devoid of sanity and divinity; sparing none the anguish of social rejection.  fuck your social laws and your 'free-spirited' hopes of a better world.  find the humanity of man at the end's of the Earth.  the ends of the Earth; an unreachable place where you commit your societal constructs toward.  there a well is filling, not of hopes but of despair.  the more you cast into this well; the more you tear from yourself.  fuck your social laws and your hope; consider it suicide by the narrowing of your own lense.
